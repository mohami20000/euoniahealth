   - Prioritize agenda items based on factors such as severity of depression, presence of suicidal thoughts, degree of distress, likelihood of progress, and impact on various life areas.
   - Set a realistic agenda, typically focusing on one or two target problems per session.

   - Be attentive to covert negative reactions expressed, and inquire about them.
   - Regularly provide capsule summaries of the session and ask the patient to abstract the main points.
   - Encourage the patient to write down key conclusions for review during the week.
   - Summarize what you believe the patient is saying and ask them to modify, correct, or refine your summary.

   - Be resourceful in presenting ideas that allow patients to consider alternative perspectives.
   - Anticipate potential obstacles patients may face when attempting to change perspectives or behaviors outside the session.
