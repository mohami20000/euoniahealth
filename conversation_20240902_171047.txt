Mo: Hi.
eunoia: Hello Mo, I'm Eunoia. It's nice to meet you. Welcome to our first session. How are you feeling about being here today?
Mo: I'm feeling good.
eunoia: That's great to hear, Mo. I'm glad you're feeling good about being here. 

Our first session will be an evaluation session. It's different from a regular therapy session, as it focuses on gathering information to help me understand your needs and how best to support you. Does that sound okay to you?
Mo: Sounds good.
eunoia: I'm glad that sounds good to you, Mo. 

Before we begin, I'd like to tell you what to expect. This is what we call "setting the agenda," and it's something we do at every session. Today, I need to find out why you're here, and I'll ask you about the symptoms you've been having, how you've been functioning lately, and about your history. Is that alright with you?
Mo: Yeah. That's alright.
eunoia: Great, Mo. I appreciate your willingness to go through this process.

Now, let's start with the most important question: What brings you in today? What's been most difficult or concerning for you lately?
Mo: I've been daydreaming too much, and it wastes my time a lot.
eunoia: Thank you for sharing that, Mo. It's helpful to know what's been troubling you. Can you tell me more about how this daydreaming has been impacting your daily life - for example, your work, relationships, or other activities?
Mo: Yeah. So, basically, when I'm daydreaming, I'm just doing nothing. Right? I'm just sitting and daydreaming. And so I'm not doing work. I'm not hanging out with people. I'm not doing any activity. Right? So just takes away from my life, essentially.
eunoia: I understand, Mo. It sounds like the daydreaming is significantly interfering with your productivity and social interactions. Thank you for explaining that.

Can you tell me how long this has been a concern for you? Has it gotten worse recently, or has it been consistent for a while?
Mo: I think I've been daydreaming since middle school, and it's has always taken time. But I guess now I've it's kind of more of a bigger deal for me because I'm trying to work hard and I'm ambitious. I'm trying to do things. You know? So the time I spend on daydreaming is way too much.
eunoia: Thank you for providing that context, Mo. It's helpful to understand the history of your daydreaming and how it's become more of a concern now that you're trying to focus on your ambitions and work.

Given that this has been a long-standing pattern, have you tried any strategies in the past to manage or reduce your daydreaming?
Mo: Yeah. I guess I I would I mean, I always try to fight it, like, when it's obvious that it's taking time away. I I've been meditating. I meditate, like, at least 5 minutes a day now. It helps me focus, I guess. Like, makes my my mind more quiet so I can focus more. But, yeah, nothing really other than that.
eunoia: Thank you for sharing that, Mo. It's great that you've been proactive in trying to address this issue. Meditation can indeed be a helpful tool for improving focus and mindfulness.

I'd like to understand a bit more about your daily routine. Can you walk me through a typical day for you, from the time you wake up until you go to bed? I'm particularly interested in when the daydreaming tends to occur and how it affects your activities.
Mo: Yeah. So I wake up. I'll shower. I will, get ready, go to work, get breakfast there, then work, have lunch, do some more work, and come maybe go to the gym, maybe not. And then I'll come back, just rest, do mindless stuff for, like, 2 hours, get, like, get on my phone, daydream, or things like that. And then I'll either, you know, either do more work or hang out with people or just keep doing mindless stuff.
eunoia: Thank you for sharing your daily routine, Mo. It's helpful to see how your day is structured. It sounds like the daydreaming tends to occur during your downtime in the evening. 

You mentioned doing "mindless stuff" for about 2 hours after work. During this time, how much of it would you say is spent daydreaming versus other activities like being on your phone?
Mo: Well, in this time, I don't know. It's hard to say. It depends on the day, I guess.
eunoia: I understand, Mo. It can be difficult to quantify, especially when it varies from day to day. 

When you do find yourself daydreaming, what kinds of things do you typically daydream about? Are there any common themes or scenarios?
Mo: Yeah. I mean, there's definitely common themes. I'm I did dream about being, like, super rich, super powerful, super in control, like, famous, popular. Right? I have a hot girl. So, yeah, I kinda yeah. Those are always the themes. Like, whether it's this Game of Thrones character I invented or this billionaire guy invented, but the common theme between them is they're both the strongest, they're both the smartest, and things like that.
eunoia: Thank you for sharing those details about your daydreams, Mo. It's helpful to understand the themes and what they represent for you. It sounds like these daydreams often involve scenarios of power, success, and admiration.

Given that these daydreams seem to be quite vivid and appealing, I'm curious about how you feel when you're not daydreaming. Do you notice any difference in your mood or thoughts when you're engaged in your daily activities versus when you're daydreaming?
Mo: I mean, daydreaming is really fun. Right? I really enjoy it. Like, it's actually genuinely fun. When I'm not doing it, I'm not, like, depressed or anything. It's just normal just normal life.
eunoia: Thank you for that insight, Mo. It's interesting to hear that you genuinely enjoy the daydreaming experience, and that you don't feel particularly different when you're not doing it.

Given that you mentioned earlier that you're ambitious and trying to work hard, how do you feel about the time spent daydreaming in relation to your goals and ambitions? Does it cause you any stress or concern?
Mo: Well, it definitely wastes my time a lot, and it takes away time from work, obviously, and that's why I'm trying to stop it. It's it's yeah. Like, I need to eliminate it so I can get to my goals.
eunoia: I appreciate your honesty, Mo. It's clear that you recognize how daydreaming is conflicting with your goals and ambitions, which is an important insight.

Now, I'd like to explore your strengths and coping strategies. Apart from meditation, which you mentioned earlier, what are some things you enjoy or that are important to you? What would you consider to be your personal strengths?
Mo: I really enjoy playing soccer. I my personal strength, I think, are really ambitious, and I, I have good awareness, I think. Yeah. What else do you know?
eunoia: Thank you for sharing that, Mo. It's great to hear about your enjoyment of soccer and your self-awareness about your ambition and personal awareness. These are valuable strengths that we can potentially leverage in our work together.

You've given me a good overview of your situation, but I want to make sure I haven't missed anything important. Is there anything else you think I should know about your daydreaming or how it's affecting your life?
Mo: No. Mainly that it just takes a lot of time, and, I need to, like, get rid of it, essentially. That's it.
eunoia: Thank you for confirming that, Mo. I appreciate your clarity about wanting to address this issue.

Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you might be experiencing what's called "maladaptive daydreaming." This is when daydreaming becomes excessive and interferes with daily functioning. It's important to remember this is just an initial impression.

In Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is the approach we'll be using, we often focus on how thoughts influence feelings and behaviors. In your case, we'll work on understanding the role these daydreams play in your life and develop strategies to help you manage them better.

We'll work collaboratively to develop a plan that feels right for you, focusing on reducing the time spent daydreaming and redirecting that energy towards your goals and ambitions. How does this sound to you?
Mo: That sounds good.
eunoia: I'm glad that sounds good to you, Mo. Your willingness to engage in this process is a great start.

Now, let's set some broad goals for our work together. Based on what you've shared, it seems like one main goal would be to reduce the time spent daydreaming so you can focus more on your work and ambitions. Is that correct? And are there any other goals you'd like to add?
Mo: No. That's the main goal.
eunoia: Thank you for confirming that, Mo. Reducing daydreaming to focus more on your work and ambitions is indeed a clear and important goal.

Now, let's create a simple Action Plan for the coming week. This will help you start moving towards your goal. Would you be willing to try one or two small tasks this week?
Mo: Yeah. That's okay.
eunoia: That's great, Mo. I appreciate your willingness to try. Let's start with something simple.

For this week, how about we try the following:

1. Each time you catch yourself starting to daydream, try to gently redirect your attention to the present moment. You could do this by focusing on your breath for a few seconds or noticing five things you can see around you.

Does this sound like something you could try?
Mo: Yeah. I can do that.
eunoia: That's excellent, Mo. I'm glad you're willing to give this a try.

To help you remember and stay motivated, let's add one more small task to your Action Plan:

2. At the end of each day, take a moment to reflect on your progress. Write down one thing you accomplished that day, no matter how small, that aligns with your goals or ambitions.

How does this sound to you? Do you think you could do this as well?
Mo: Yeah. I can do it.
eunoia: That's great, Mo. I'm really pleased with your commitment to try these tasks.

To summarize our session today:

1. We discussed your concern about excessive daydreaming and how it's interfering with your work and ambitions.
2. We explored your daily routine and the themes of your daydreams.
3. We identified that reducing daydreaming to focus more on your work and ambitions is your main goal.
4. We created an Action Plan with two tasks: redirecting your attention when you start daydreaming, and reflecting on daily accomplishments.

Does this summary accurately reflect our discussion? Is there anything you think I've misunderstood or that you'd like to add?
Mo: No. This looks good.
eunoia: I'm glad the summary looks good to you, Mo. Thank you for your active participation in our session today.

Before we wrap up, do you have any questions about what we've discussed or about the plan moving forward?
Mo: No.
eunoia: I appreciate your clarity, Mo. Since you don't have any questions, let's conclude our session here.

Remember to try the two tasks we discussed in your Action Plan this week:
1. Gently redirecting your attention when you catch yourself starting to daydream.
2. Reflecting on and writing down one accomplishment each day.

In our next session, we'll discuss how these tasks went for you and dive deeper into strategies to help you manage your daydreaming and focus on your goals.

Thank you for your openness and engagement today. I look forward to our next session. Take care, Mo.
